# Operators
Hyland Hackathon 2022 First Place Winner

Operator is a game which lets students take on graphing problems in a 3D environment. 
We wanted to make sure students have access to math problems that engage them both on an educational and fun level. Many students have disdain for educational games, so we hope to break that stigma and encourage them to pursue learning. Also included is our slideshow presentation that we gave to the judges.
